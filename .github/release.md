feat: stabilize playback sync, richer notifications, and requests tooling

Added
- Optional `.env` bootstrap to skip the first-run wizard (`JF_HOST`, `JF_API_KEY`, `JS_AUTH_MODE=local`, `JS_USER`, `JS_PASSWORD`, `JS_SKIP_FIRST_RUN`, `JS_AUTO_START_SYNC`)
- First-run backup restore path for headless / Compose installs
- Debounced materialized-view refreshes under heavy playback webhook load
- Discord and Gotify media cards for playback and download events (poster artwork, viewer avatar on Discord, client/device details)
- Requests status pipeline (requested → approved → grabbed → available) with stage filters and richer cards
- Seerr Issues inbox on the Requests page for Overseerr/Jellyseerr reports
- Per-user Films/TV root-folder overrides on user cards, with sync to Seerr plus linked Radarr/Sonarr paths
- Multi-campaign newsletters (global, role-based, and personal) with shared SMTP, section toggles, preview, and schedules
- Downloads queue remove action when the download client supports it
- Brief Home/Requests API response caching and finer Vite vendor chunk splitting
- Dedicated JellyGlance GitHub Action bots plus PR validation / Actions naming standards

Fixed
- Webhook bursts no longer crash-loop JellyGlance on native/systemd installs ([#80](https://github.com/Nerdy-Technician/JellyGlance/pull/80))
- Playback webhook spam from session flicker / device-id churn is filtered; episode start alerts are more reliable
- Discord rich embeds no longer drop when multipart image uploads fail (text card still sends)
- Active Sessions cards truncate long stream labels and titles so desktop/mobile layouts no longer overlap
- Requests Issues layout no longer leaves a large empty gap under the filters
- Outbound HTTPS prefers IPv4 to avoid dual-stack timeouts to Cloudflare-hosted Seerr/Arr hosts
- Release pipeline now commits package version bumps back to the branch so GitHub tags stay in sync with `package.json`

Changed
- Release documentation now describes the file-driven Release Bot pipeline as the canonical release path
- Dependency bumps for production and development packages
